	 it 'The code defines a method called `action_allowed?` which checks if a user is allowed to perform a certain action on a response. It takes no arguments and returns a boolean value. The method first initializes `response` and `user_id` to `nil`. If the requested action is `edit`, `delete`, `update`, or `view`, it sets `response` to the corresponding response object found by its ID in the parameters, and sets `user_id` to the ID of the reviewer who reviewed the response, if any. The method then uses a `case` statement to determine what action is being requested, and performs a different set of checks depending on the action. If the action is `edit`, it returns `false` if the response has already been submitted, otherwise it checks if the current user is a reviewer for that responses map. If the action is `delete` or `update`, it checks if the current user is a reviewer for that responses map. If the action is `view`, it checks if the current user is allowed to edit the response (i.e. if they are the author of the response or a reviewer for its map). If the action is anything else, it just checks if the user is logged in. Overall, the method is used to determine whether a user has permission to perform a certain action on a response, based on their role as the author, a reviewer, or just a logged-in user.'

	 it 'The ruby code  defines a method called "authorize_show_calibration_results". This method takes no arguments but relies on the "params" hash and the "current_user_is_reviewer?" method. It first retrieves a ResponseMap object based on the "review_response_map_id" parameter in the "params" hash. It then extracts the user ID of the reviewer associated with this ResponseMap. Finally, it checks if the current user is a reviewer (using the "current_user_is_reviewer?" method) and if not, it sets a flash message and redirects the user to the "list" action of the "student_review" controller for the user associated with the ResponseMap. Overall, this method is used to control access to a calibration result page, allowing only reviewers to view it.'

  describe '#json' do

	 it 'The code defines a method called "delete" which is used to delete a response. It first checks if team-based reviewing is enabled, and if so, gets a lock on the response using the Lock class. If the lock cannot be obtained, the method returns. Next, it checks if the user is authorized to delete the response by checking the ID of the responses associated map. The response is then deleted, and the user is redirected to a specified action with a message indicating that the response was deleted. There are some comments in the code that describe other methods and functionality, but they are not directly related to the "delete" method.'

It then sorts the responses by version number, with the largest version number being assigned to a variable. If team-based reviewing is enabled for the map, it attempts to acquire a lock on the response for the current user. If successful, it sets the "modified_object" variable to the response ID and retrieves the review scores for each question in the questionnaire. Finally, it sets some variables for the view and renders the "response" template.'

Then it checks if team-based reviewing is enabled and if the response is locked, and if so, it performs a lock action. It updates the responses additional comment with the comments from the params. It sorts the questions in the questionnaire and creates answers if there are any responses in the params. If the "isSubmit" parameter is set to "Yes", it updates the responses "is_submitted" attribute to true. If the map is a ReviewResponseMap and the response is submitted and has a significant difference, it notifies the instructor. If an error occurs, it sets a message indicating that the response was not saved. Finally, it logs the submission and redirects the user to the "save" action in the "response" controller with some parameters.'

The method extracts the subject, body, response, and email parameters from the form submission. Then, it checks if the subject and body parameters are blank. If they are, it sets a flash error message and redirects the user back to the previous page. Otherwise, it invokes a helper method named "send_mail_to_author_reviewers" from the MailerHelper module passing the subject, body, and email as arguments. Finally, it sets a flash success message and redirects the user to the student_task list page. The method responds to both HTML and JSON formats.'

It finds a response object based on the given ID (if provided) and then finds the current users assignment participant for that responses assignment. It then finds or creates a feedback response map for that user and response. Finally, it redirects to the "new" action with the maps ID and a return parameter set to "feedback". If no response is found, it redirects back to the root path.'

It first checks if a questionnaire ID is provided, and if so, sets the questionnaire and round variables. It then checks if the response object already exists for the given map and round, and if not, creates a new one with the provided comments and submission status. It then updates the response object with any additional comments and submission status provided in the params. If the response object is submitted for the first time and there is a significant difference in the responses, it sends notifications to instructors and emails the response. Finally, it redirects back to the response save action with success/error messages and any relevant parameters.'

The method first retrieves any error or message IDs from the parameters and sets them as flash messages if they exist. It then retrieves a response object based on the "map_id" parameter and uses a switch statement to determine where to redirect the user based on the value of "params:return". The possible destinations include feedback, teammate, instructor, assignment_edit, selfreview, survey, bookmark, and ta_review.

In the "edit" case, the method sets instance variables for the header, the next action, a response object, a map object related to the response, and a contributor object related to the map. In the "new" case, the method sets instance variables for the header, the next action, a feedback parameter, a response map object, and a modified object (which is set to the id of the response map). In both cases, the method sets an instance variable for the return parameter. The method is likely used in a larger application to set parameters for different actions, such as creating or editing responses, and to set instance variables that will be used in the applications view templates.'
