# Code Review: Notice that Participant overloads two different concepts:
#              contribution and participant (see fields of the participant table).
#              Consider creating a new table called contributions.
#
# Alias methods exist in this class which append 'get_' to many method names. Use
# the idiomatic ruby method names (without get_)
